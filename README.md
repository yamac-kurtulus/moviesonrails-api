# moviesonrails

A ruby project where users can register and follow movies based on their genre, name and actors. It uses a combination of the [movie lens small dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) (~9000 movies) tailored to fit this project for movie selection  (so that we would have a selection of popular movies) and [OpenMovieDatabase](www.omdbapi.com) for movie information. Since the time is limited, and OMDB has a limit of 1000 requests/day, A smaller dataset of movielens had to be used.
